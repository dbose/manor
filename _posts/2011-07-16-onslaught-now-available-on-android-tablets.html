<p>Hot on the heels of our announcement of 	<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught!/id441426241">Onslaught! for iPad</a>, 	we're now equally as thrilled to announce 	<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.gameclosure.tealeaf">Onslaught! for Android</a>. 	This is again without any additional code on our part, thanks to <a href="http://gameclosure.com/">Game Closure</a>'s awesome technology. 	Read all about it in our previous article, <a href="/the-road-to-a-production-quality-html5-game-o">"The road to a production-quality HTML5 game on iOS"</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's currently only compatible with Android tablets, 	but we are working on a version that will work with Android phones too. 	<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames">Follow us on Twitter</a> to know be notified as soon as it's available!</p>
