Welcome to our new website! As web developers, we've been aware that our site has been a bit ... sad? For entirely too long now. So we rolled up our sleeves, made a brand new design and moved our blog off of [Posterous](http://posterous.com/).

# What's different?

http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/

* Bad news for fans of waiting! The entire site is much faster. Our pages are entirely static HTML and external files are being hosted from Google's lightning fast web servers.
* The blog is now powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) -- a "blog-aware, static site generator." This allows us more control over our content and we can write using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (which makes Geoff especially happy).
* Entire website is now running on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) (which conveniently supports Jekyll).
* Website is more tightly integrated with [code examples on GitHub](https://github.com/lostdecade).
* We're using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to make writing CSS more awesome.
* [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) for avatars, because Gravatar is awesome and the more stuff we host in the cloud, the easier our lives are.

# So long, comments!

We mourn the loss of our comments. Thank you to all who contributed to discussions on our blog, but we hope that moving forward, relying on social networks for interaction with our fans and readers will be adequate. As always, please feel free to [email us](/contact/).

# More stuff coming soon

We'll be making a more substantial page for [Onslaught!](/onslaught_arena/), designing an actual title, and fixing any issues that may arise. What do you think? Do you have a setup for your website that's similar to ours? Let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames)!
